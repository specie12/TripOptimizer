# TripOptimizer - AI Travel Agent & Personal CFO Roadmap

## Vision

An AI-powered travel agent that acts as both a **travel advisor** and a **personal trip CFO**. The system treats budget as a first-class constraint, continuously planning, booking, and adjusting trips to deliver the best possible experience within financial limits.

**Core Philosophy:** Budget-first, not budget-last. Instead of planning a dream trip and budgeting later, the system optimizes every decision around the user's financial constraints from the start.

---

## Multi-Agent Architecture

TripOptimizer employs a **multi-agent architecture** where a central orchestrator coordinates specialized AI agents, each responsible for a specific domain of the trip lifecycle.

### Architecture Overview

### Agent Responsibilities

#### 1. Orchestrator Agent (Central Coordinator)
**Role:** Manages the entire trip lifecycle and coordinates all specialized agents

**Responsibilities:**
- Receives user requests and determines which agents to invoke
- Maintains trip state across the planning-to-completion lifecycle
- Routes tasks to appropriate specialized agents
- Aggregates responses and resolves conflicts between agents
- Manages agent execution order and dependencies
- Provides unified response to user interface

**Key Decisions:**
- When to trigger re-optimization
- How to handle conflicting agent recommendations
- When to escalate to user for decisions
- Priority ordering when multiple agents need resources

#### 2. Budget Agent
**Role:** Owns all financial aspects of the trip

**Responsibilities:**
- Initial budget allocation across 6 categories
- Real-time spend tracking and remaining budget calculation
- Budget reallocation when priorities change
- Enforces hard budget constraints across all decisions
- Provides budget health reports to orchestrator
- Alerts when categories approach/exceed limits

**Inputs:** Total budget, user priorities, spend records
**Outputs:** Category allocations, remaining budgets, budget alerts

#### 3. Optimization Agent
**Role:** Continuously finds better options within constraints

**Responsibilities:**
- Monitors prices for unlocked items
- Identifies savings opportunities (>10% threshold)
- Generates alternative recommendations
- Respects lock-down constraints
- Balances optimization aggressiveness with user preferences
- Ranks alternatives by value improvement

**Inputs:** Current selections, price feeds, lock statuses, budget constraints
**Outputs:** Optimization opportunities, alternative recommendations

#### 4. Booking Agent
**Role:** Manages the actual booking process

**Responsibilities:**
- Validates availability before booking
- Executes bookings through integrated APIs
- Handles booking confirmations and receipts
- Manages booking modifications and cancellations
- Extracts structured data from booking confirmations
- Updates trip state with confirmed bookings

**Inputs:** Selected options, user payment info, booking requests
**Outputs:** Booking confirmations, booking failures, modification results

#### 5. Monitoring Agent
**Role:** Watches for changes that affect the trip

**Responsibilities:**
- Tracks price changes on watched items
- Monitors flight schedule changes
- Detects hotel availability changes
- Watches for relevant alerts (weather, events, closures)
- Triggers notifications for significant changes
- Feeds data to optimization agent

**Inputs:** Watched items, external feeds, alert sources
**Outputs:** Change notifications, price updates, schedule alerts

#### 6. Exception Agent
**Role:** Handles disruptions and problems

**Responsibilities:**
- Manages cancellations and rebooking
- Handles schedule conflicts
- Processes refunds and credits
- Resolves booking failures
- Coordinates recovery from disruptions
- Communicates issues to user with solutions

**Inputs:** Exception events, current bookings, available alternatives
**Outputs:** Resolution actions, rebooking options, refund status

### Agent Communication Protocol

```typescript
interface AgentMessage {
  messageId: string;
  fromAgent: AgentType;
  toAgent: AgentType;
  messageType: 'REQUEST' | 'RESPONSE' | 'EVENT' | 'ALERT';
  priority: 'LOW' | 'MEDIUM' | 'HIGH' | 'CRITICAL';
  payload: unknown;
  correlationId?: string;  // Links related messages
  timestamp: Date;
}

type AgentType =
  | 'ORCHESTRATOR'
  | 'BUDGET'
  | 'OPTIMIZATION'
  | 'BOOKING'
  | 'MONITORING'
  | 'EXCEPTION';
```

### Agent State Machine

Each trip progresses through states, with different agents active at each stage:

```
PLANNING → OPTIMIZING → BOOKING → CONFIRMED → ACTIVE → COMPLETED
    │          │           │          │          │
    └── Budget Agent ──────┴──────────┘          │
    └── Optimization Agent ───────────┴──────────┘
                   └── Booking Agent ─┴──────────┘
                              └── Monitoring Agent ┘
                                        └── Exception Agent (on-demand)
```

---

## Executive Summary: Current State

**TripOptimizer MVP is a budget-conscious flight + hotel matching engine** with:
- Deterministic budget allocation across 3 categories (flight, hotel, buffer)
- Multi-factor scoring system for ranking trip options
- AI-powered explanations and itineraries (Claude)
- Passive personalization based on user behavior
- Booking data parsing and entity verification agents
- 3-page frontend flow (input → confirm → results)

**What's Working Well:**
- Budget is enforced as a hard constraint
- Scoring is fully deterministic (no AI influence)
- Personalization is confidence-gated and reversible
- Architecture cleanly separates AI text generation from business logic

**What's Missing for Full Vision:**
- Only 3 budget categories (needs 6)
- No lock-down mechanism for confirmed bookings
- No real-time spend tracking
- No continuous optimization
- Mock data only (no real API integrations)
- No activities, food, or ground transport

- [ ] Add agent execution logging and tracing
- [ ] Implement agent health checks and status reporting

**Files to Create:**
```
src/agents/
├── types.ts                    # AgentType, AgentMessage, AgentContext
├── base.agent.ts               # Abstract Agent base class
├── orchestrator.agent.ts       # Central orchestrator
├── registry.ts                 # Agent registration and discovery
├── message-bus.ts              # Inter-agent communication
├── state-machine.ts            # Trip lifecycle state management
├── budget.agent.ts             # Budget agent (stub)
├── optimization.agent.ts       # Optimization agent (stub)
├── booking.agent.ts            # Booking agent (stub)
├── monitoring.agent.ts         # Monitoring agent (stub)
└── exception.agent.ts          # Exception agent (stub)
```

**Agent Base Class:**
```typescript
abstract class Agent {
  abstract readonly type: AgentType;
  abstract readonly capabilities: string[];

  abstract initialize(context: AgentContext): Promise<void>;
  abstract handleMessage(message: AgentMessage): Promise<AgentMessage | null>;
  abstract healthCheck(): Promise<AgentHealth>;

  protected async sendMessage(to: AgentType, payload: unknown): Promise<void>;
  protected async requestFromAgent<T>(to: AgentType, payload: unknown): Promise<T>;
}
```

**Orchestrator Pattern:**
```typescript
class OrchestratorAgent extends Agent {
  async planTrip(request: TripRequest): Promise<TripPlan> {
    // 1. Ask Budget Agent to allocate budget
    const allocation = await this.requestFromAgent<BudgetAllocation>(
      'BUDGET',
      { type: 'ALLOCATE', budget: request.budget, priorities: request.priorities }
    );

    // 2. Generate candidates within budget constraints
    const candidates = await this.generateCandidates(allocation);

    // 3. Ask Optimization Agent to rank candidates
    const ranked = await this.requestFromAgent<RankedOptions>(
      'OPTIMIZATION',
      { type: 'RANK', candidates, constraints: allocation }
    );

    return { options: ranked.top3, allocation };
  }
}
```

**Estimated Scope:** Large (Foundation for all future phases)

---

### Phase 1: Extended Budget Categories & Constraints
**Goal:** Upgrade from 3 to 6 budget categories; add user priorities

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Define 6 budget categories: Flight, Hotel, Activity, Food, Transport, Contingency
- [ ] Create `BudgetCategory` enum in Prisma schema
- [ ] Update `BudgetConfig` to support all 6 categories
- [ ] Modify budget allocation service for multi-category split
- [ ] Add priority ranking inputs to frontend form
- [ ] Store user constraints/priorities in TripRequest (JSON fields)
- [ ] Update confirmation page to show full budget breakdown

**Files to Create/Modify:**
```
src/types/budget.types.ts          # Extended budget types
src/services/budget.service.ts     # Multi-category allocation
prisma/schema.prisma               # BudgetCategory enum, TripRequest extensions
frontend/components/TripInputForm.tsx    # Priority inputs
frontend/components/BudgetBreakdown.tsx  # 6-category display
```

**Estimated Scope:** Medium

---

### Phase 2: Lock-Down Mechanism
**Goal:** Allow users to "lock" confirmed bookings; prevent re-optimization of locked items

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add `LockStatus` enum: UNLOCKED, LOCKED, CONFIRMED
- [ ] Add `lockStatus` and `lockedAt` fields to TripOption
- [ ] Create lock-down service with business rules

prisma/schema.prisma               # LockStatus enum, TripOption fields
frontend/components/LockToggle.tsx # UI component
```

**Business Rules:**
- UNLOCKED → LOCKED: User clicks "Lock this choice"
- LOCKED → CONFIRMED: User completes external booking
- CONFIRMED items cannot be unlocked
- Re-optimization ignores LOCKED and CONFIRMED items

**Estimated Scope:** Medium

---

### Phase 3: Activities Integration
**Goal:** Add tours, attractions, and experiences as a scored category

**Tasks:**
